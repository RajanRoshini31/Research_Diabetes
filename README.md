## Abstract

Our research presents a comprehensive approach to the early detection of diabetes by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Random Forest Classifiers, and Gradient Boosting were evaluated on medical datasets enhanced by Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to handle class imbalance. The study also integrates Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to increase transparency and trustworthiness in model predictions, aiming to improve healthcare outcomes.
